# img2signal
The goal of this project is to create a library of tools for analysing images inside a browser using HTML5 (JS & Canvas). This project is mostly meant for academic purposes and to aid research in the field of image manipulation & convolutional neural networks.

# Setup
Clone the repository, open index.html in your browser. It should be noted that only Firefox will work with the initial commit as Chrome will not allow to process imageData from a canvas with images loaded locally without overriding security settings (not recommended). An improvement is on the way that will allow more convenient running, development and playing around.

## Version history
